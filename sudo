###Sudo using Hyphen
	
	--------------------------------------------
	## su - user vs su user
	---------
	Whatâ€™s happening?
	The hyphen has two effects:
	1) switches from the current directory to the home directory of the new user (e.g., to /root in the case of the root user) by logging in as that user
	2) changes the environmental variables to those of the new user as dictated by their ~/.bashrc. That is, if the first argument to su is a hyphen, the current directory and environment will be changed to what would be expected if the new user had actually logged on to a new session (rather than just taking over an existing session).
